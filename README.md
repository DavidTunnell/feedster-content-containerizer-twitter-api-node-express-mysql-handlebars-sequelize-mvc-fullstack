## User Story
```
AS a user (for example: millennials and beyond or basically any one with an internet connected device) I 
WANT to subscribe to twitter feeds for a specific topic/category 
SO AS to view a mix of content on my account page that others can follow along to keep up with what I keep track of/like to read.
```

## Project Requirements

Apply everything we’ve learnt over the past six units to create a real-world full-stack application that we'll showcase to potential employers. Besides the user story and acceptance criteria our project fulfils the following requirements:

✔️ Use Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API.
✔️ Use Handlebars.js as the template engine.
✔️ Use MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database.
✔️ Have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.
✔️ Use at least one new library, package, or technology that we haven’t discussed.
✔️ Have a folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm.
✔️ Include authentication (express-session and cookies).
✔️ Protect API keys and sensitive information with environment variables.
✔️ Be deployed using Heroku (with data).
✔️ Have a polished UI.
✔️ Be responsive.
✔️ Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
✔️ Meet good-quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).
✔️ Have a professional README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
